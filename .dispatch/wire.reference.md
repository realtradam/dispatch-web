# `@dispatch/wire` — in-repo reference (read THIS, not node_modules)

> MIRRORS the backend's `@dispatch/wire` package source so headless FE agents can read the wire
> types WITHOUT following the `file:` dep symlink out of this repo (which hangs on a permission
> prompt). Your CODE still imports `@dispatch/wire` normally — this file is for READING only.
>
> **Orchestrator:** SNAPSHOT of `wire@0.6.1` (doc-only bump: the 1-based gap-free seq guarantee
> codified on `StoredChunk`). Regenerate whenever `@dispatch/wire` changes.
>
> **2026-06-12 delta (CR-5 history windowing — package bumped `0.6.0` → `0.6.1`, DOC-ONLY):** the
> per-conversation `seq` numbering is now a WRITTEN CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEE on `StoredChunk`:
> **1-based, monotonic, gap-free** — a conversation's first chunk is always `seq === 1` and
> numbering never skips. A client holding only a windowed suffix of the log derives "older chunks
> exist server-side" purely from `oldestLoaded.seq > 1` (no `earliestSeq`/`hasOlder` field exists).
>
> **2026-06-12 delta (CR-3 user-message handoff — package bumped `0.5.0` → `0.6.0`, ADDITIVE):** adds a
> new `AgentEvent` union member `TurnInputEvent` (`{ type: "user-message"; conversationId; turnId; text }`)
> that surfaces the turn's USER prompt INTO the outward event stream. Emitted ONCE as the FIRST event of
> every turn (before `turn-start`), so it is buffered + replayed to every subscriber — live AND late-join
> — and rides `chat.delta`/NDJSON like any other event. Fixes CR-3 (a pure watcher couldn't see the prompt
> until seal). The sender still echoes its own prompt optimistically, so consumers DE-DUP against that
> (by text); a pure watcher renders it directly. Persistence/metrics unchanged. See `TurnInputEvent` below.
>
> **2026-06-12 delta (context-size handoff — package bumped `0.4.0` → `0.5.0`):** adds an OPTIONAL
> `contextSize?: number` to BOTH `TurnDoneEvent` (live `done`) and `TurnMetrics` (persisted) — the
> turn's FINAL step `inputTokens + outputTokens` (current context occupancy), NOT the aggregate
> `usage` (which overcounts multi-step turns). The two carriers are equal for the same turn. Current
> value = the LATEST turn's `contextSize`; `undefined` ⇒ render "unknown", never `0`. See the field
> doc-comments on `TurnMetrics`/`TurnDoneEvent` below.
>
> **0.3.0 changes (token + timing metrics):**
> - **Live per-step/per-turn telemetry on the event stream** (transient — NOT persisted):
>   `TurnUsageEvent` gained an OPTIONAL `stepId?` (attribute tokens per step). A NEW
>   `TurnStepCompleteEvent` (`type: "step-complete"`, REQUIRED `stepId`) carries the per-step
>   generation timing `ttftMs?` / `decodeMs?` / `genTotalMs?` (all optional — present only when the
>   runtime had a clock; `ttftMs`/`decodeMs` additionally require a first content token). `TurnDoneEvent`
>   gained an OPTIONAL `durationMs?` (total turn wall-clock) + OPTIONAL `usage?` (aggregate across
>   steps). `TurnToolResultEvent` gained an OPTIONAL `durationMs?` (tool execution time).
> - **Durable, replayable metrics** (persisted, keyed per turn): NEW `StepMetrics` + `TurnMetrics`
>   — the persisted counterparts of the live `usage` + `step-complete` + `done` packets. Served by
>   `GET /conversations/:id/metrics` (see `transport-contract.reference.md`). Build the SAME
>   `TurnMetrics` shape from the live events for the in-flight turn; the durable endpoint supplies it
>   for sealed turns. TPS is derived (`usage.outputTokens / (genTotalMs / 1000)`), not on the wire.
> - **0.2.0 (still current — step grouping):** `ToolCallChunk`/`ToolResultChunk` carry an OPTIONAL
>   `stepId?: StepId`; `TurnToolCallEvent`/`TurnToolResultEvent` carry a REQUIRED `stepId: StepId`.
>   Group batched/parallel tool calls by `stepId` equality. Live: read `event.stepId`. Replay: read
>   `storedChunk.chunk.stepId` (NOT the envelope; tolerate absence). `StoredChunk` envelope is
>   UNCHANGED (`{ seq, role, chunk }` — carries NO `turnId`).
