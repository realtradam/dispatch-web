# `@dispatch/wire` — in-repo reference (read THIS, not node_modules)

> MIRRORS the backend's `@dispatch/wire` package source so headless FE agents can read the wire
> types WITHOUT following the `file:` dep symlink out of this repo (which hangs on a permission
> prompt). Your CODE still imports `@dispatch/wire` normally — this file is for READING only.
>
> **Orchestrator:** SNAPSHOT of `wire@0.12.0` (workspaces + computers). Regenerate whenever `@dispatch/wire` changes.
>
> **2026-06-26 delta (vision handoff — ADDITIVE to `wire@0.12.0`, NO version bump):** adds a new
> `ImageChunk` variant to the `Chunk` union (`{ type: "image", url, mimeType? }` — `url` is a base64 data
> URL or an `http(s)://` URL) and a transport-facing `ImageInput` (`{ url, mimeType? }`, what a client
> sends on `ChatRequest.images`; the orchestrator converts each into an `ImageChunk` on the persisted user
> message). Vision-capable models receive image chunks natively; non-vision models never see them directly
> — the orchestrator's vision handoff transcribes each to a text description (persisted as a separate
> `text` chunk in the SAME user message). See `backend-handoff.md` §2j.
>
> **2026-06-26 update (image storage — NO type change, behavior only):** `ImageChunk.url` for PERSISTED
> chunks is now a compact relative HTTP path (`/images/<conversationId>/<uuid>.png`) served by the backend's
> new `GET /images/:conversationId/:imageId` endpoint (raw bytes + correct Content-Type), NOT a base64 data
> URL — images are stored on disk under tmp, not in the SQLite conversation store (keeps payloads small).
> `ImageInput.url` (what a client SENDS on `ChatRequest.images`) is UNCHANGED — still a data URL or
> `http(s)://` URL; the backend saves it to tmp and returns the compact path in the persisted chunk. A client
> resolves a relative `url` against its API base (`resolveImageUrl`); a data URL (the optimistic echo) or an
> absolute URL passes through unchanged. See `backend-handoff.md` §2j.
>
> **2026-06-23 delta (workspaces handoff — package bumped `0.11.0` → `0.12.0`, ADDITIVE):** adds
> `Workspace` + `WorkspaceEntry` (a list entry with a conversation count) and a required
> `workspaceId: string` on `ConversationMeta` (`"default"` for legacy/unspecified conversations). A
> workspace is a URL-driven grouping of conversations that owns a default cwd; conversations that
> haven't set their own cwd inherit `workspace.defaultCwd`. See `backend-handoff-workspaces-reply.md`.
>
> **2026-06-25 delta (SSH handoff #1 — ADDITIVE to `wire@0.12.0`, NO version bump):** adds a REQUIRED
> `defaultComputerId: string | null` on `Workspace` (null = local / no SSH; the computer analog of
> `defaultCwd`) and two new read-only view types: `Computer` (a discovered `~/.ssh/config` `Host` alias)
> and `ComputerEntry extends Computer` (a list entry with a `usageCount`). `alias` IS the `computerId`
> users select (persisted per-conversation/per-workspace like cwd). The full HTTP API surface
> (`GET /computers`, `PUT /conversations/:id/computer`, `PUT /workspaces/:id/default-computer`,
> `GET /computers/:alias/status`, `chat.send computerId`) comes in a LATER handoff — NOT consumed yet.
>
> **⚠️ CROSS-REPO DIVERGENCE (2026-06-25, BLOCKING FE typecheck):** the backend `feature/ssh-support`
> branch (where the SSH types landed) was cut from `8a74335` and is MISSING the `TurnProviderRetryEvent` /
> `provider-retry` `AgentEvent` addition that is on `dev` (and which the FE already consumes — see §2c of
