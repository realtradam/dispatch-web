/**
 * Transport contract — the typed description of Dispatch's client–server API
 * (HTTP + WebSocket).
 *
 * This package is types-only (zero runtime). It is the single shared surface
 * every client imports to know how to talk to the backend — the CLI, the web
 * frontend (in its own repo), any third-party client — and the transport-http /
 * transport-ws servers import to know what they must accept and emit.
 *
 * Each side owns its OWN (de)serialization: there is deliberately no shared
 * parse/serialize helper here (isolation-over-DRY). The contract is the SHAPES,
 * not the codec. The streaming response payload is the kernel's `AgentEvent`
 * union, re-exported here so a client has one import for the whole wire.
 *
 * The WebSocket carries BOTH chat ops (defined here) and surface ops (defined in
 * `@dispatch/ui-contract`) over one connection; the unified `WsClientMessage` /
 * `WsServerMessage` unions below compose them. Chat ops are new, non-colliding
 * `type` variants — there is no channel wrapper, so the shipped surface protocol
 * is unchanged.

 * combine as one SELECTION + one WINDOW:
 *
 * - **Selection** — `sinceSeq` (exclusive lower bound, `seq > n`; omitted/0 =
 *   from the start) and `beforeSeq` (exclusive upper bound, `seq < s`; omitted
 *   = to the end). Together: `n < seq < s`.
 * - **Window** — `limit=<k>` returns only the NEWEST `k` chunks of the
 *   selection (the response stays ASCENDING by seq). A selection with ≤ `k`
 *   chunks is returned whole. `limit` omitted = the full selection — exactly
 *   the pre-windowing behavior, so existing clients are unchanged.
 * - `limit` and `beforeSeq` must be POSITIVE integers (`sinceSeq` may be 0);
 *   malformed, zero, or negative values → HTTP 400 `{ error }`.
 *
 * Intended client flows: fresh load = `?sinceSeq=0&limit=<k>` (newest window);
 * tail sync = `?sinceSeq=<cursor>` (no limit); page older history in =
 * `?beforeSeq=<oldestLoadedSeq>&limit=<k>`.
 *
 * Seq numbering is **1-based and gap-free** (a CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEE — see
 * `StoredChunk` in `@dispatch/wire`): a client can derive "older chunks exist"
 * purely from `oldestLoaded.seq > 1`; there is deliberately no
 * `earliestSeq`/`hasOlder` response field.
 *
 * `chunks` is the RAW, append-order, seq-ordered slice of the conversation log
 * selected + windowed as above. It is NOT reconciled: a dangling tool-call is
 * returned as-is (rendered as an interrupted call). Reconciliation is a
 * turn-path concern — the server repairs history only when it feeds a provider,
 * never on this read path — which is what preserves the per-chunk `seq` cursor
 * invariant (a synthesized repair chunk would have no seq).
 *
 * `latestSeq` is the `seq` of the LAST chunk in this response, or — when the
 * slice is empty (the client is already caught up) — the requested `sinceSeq`
 * (0 for a full read of an empty conversation). So after applying the response a
 * client's new cursor is always `latestSeq`, and an empty `chunks` means
 * "nothing new past your cursor". CAVEAT (windowed reads): `latestSeq` is a
 * TAIL-sync cursor — on a `beforeSeq` backfill page (or any `limit`ed read that
 * did not reach the log's true tail) it describes the returned window, NOT the
 * conversation's high-water mark, so a client must not regress its sync cursor
 * from a backfill response. (A true server-side high-water mark independent of
 * the filter is deferred until a consumer needs it — it would require widening
