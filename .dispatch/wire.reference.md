# `@dispatch/wire` — in-repo reference (read THIS, not node_modules)

> MIRRORS the backend's `@dispatch/wire` package source so headless FE agents can read the wire
> types WITHOUT following the `file:` dep symlink out of this repo (which hangs on a permission
> prompt). Your CODE still imports `@dispatch/wire` normally — this file is for READING only.
>
> **Orchestrator:** SNAPSHOT of `wire@0.2.0`. Regenerate whenever `@dispatch/wire` changes.
>
> **0.2.0 change (step grouping):** `ToolCallChunk`/`ToolResultChunk` gained an OPTIONAL
> `stepId?: StepId`; `TurnToolCallEvent`/`TurnToolResultEvent` gained a REQUIRED `stepId: StepId`.
> A `StepId` is the per-step grouping key for batched/parallel tool calls — group by equality.
> Live: read `event.stepId`. Replay: read `storedChunk.chunk.stepId` (NOT the envelope; absent on
> pre-0.2.0 rows / non-tool chunks — tolerate absence). `StoredChunk` envelope is UNCHANGED.
